When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want others to be able to view the files too.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that I can control the differences between what I'm working on privately and what is accessible to the public.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a copy of a github repo to your github account, a clone is a copy of a repo to your local system, a branch is a branch. lol.
