How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	Finding the diff between the two files helped me know where the changes were and made it easier to spot the differences between the files and where the probable error(s) might be.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It could help me go back to changes I have made a long time ago and review and edit my code base applicably.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Manually choosing when to commit makes it possible to make the commit history more logical, but it also makes it easy to lose track of changes when one forgets to commit.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because Git is created mainly for code base which often requires tracking changed across multiple files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	Knowing I could easily go back and undo the changes, I will be much more confident to make drastic changes.
